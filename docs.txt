The jQuery Audio Player plugin

==================
NOTES
==================

The plugin will load an MP3 or OGG file and play it. The running time and current
volume can be fetched and displayed.

There is much to do, such as:

* Add id3 data population of player title and description
* Allow an audio metadata structure to be used on the load function
* Playlist functionality

The player will be implemented as a set of plugins so that anyone can build the exact functionality
that they want.

==================
To Use the examples
==================

Add the jQuery library v 1.2.6 and an MP3 or OGG file to the working directory and edit example.html to play it.

Example 01

This is a plain old player that show the basic functionality of the module

Example 02

This has a main window which pops up the player in a second window. It assumes that only an ID is required by the player, and that the player will go and fetch the data from somewhere (via ajax, for example).

Does not do anything else yet... 

Example 03

This opens the audio in the popup window and plays it. Simple and Easy.

It works by attaching a popup event to all audio links on the page, and sending the full file path to the player.

You can have MP3 and Vorbis links on the same page and they'll play (in Firefox 3.1).

RELEASES
==================

# 0.24 (20 Nov 2008) 

Added a popup (new browser window) version of the player which can pass data from the main site window to the player. 

This is done via a shared cookie-based queue. The point is so users can move from page to page, click on several audio items, and for those to be added to the floating player window.

There are two axample of this. 

Example 02 sends the id attribute from the audio link to player (for the player to handle in some way).

Example 03 sends the href (the link to the audio) to the player. The audio plays right away.

# 0.11 (20 Nov 2008) 

A bunch of small improvements to ensure the plugin API is stable under all conditions, and a new parameter that can be used during the initialisation phase to not load flash (for people who want to stick to free software). Also implemented the new type attribute in the audio tag.

The player now drives the timer updates via events. I figure most people won't want to think about formatting times so the player now sends an event every 1 second for the formatted time. (this will eventually be configurable to allow 1/10 second resolution).

There were also changes to the way the player interacts with the audio element.

The code for updating the audio item time was moved to a function to allow us to be more specific about when  it is called and also to help with moving to driving the udpates via events. 

# 0.1 

The initial release is fairly basic – you can give it an MP3 or Ogg file (in Firefox 3.1 which has built in Ogg Vorbis support) – and it will play it.

CREDITS
==================

The player was inspired by MooSound. (We had to use jQuery.)

The flash player is mostly the same as the one used by MooSound with some changes.
