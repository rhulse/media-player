The jQuery Audio Player plugin

==================
NOTES
==================

The plugin will load an MP3 or OGG file and play it. The running time and current
volume can be fetched and displayed.

There is much to do, such as:

* Add id3 data population of player title and description
* Allow an audio metadata structure to be used on the load function
* Playlist functionality

The player will be implemented as a set of plugins so that anyone can build the exact functionality
that they want.

==================
To Use the example
==================

Add the jQuery library v 1.2.6 and an MP3 or OGG file to the working directory and edit example.html to play it.  

==================
Files included
==================

Flash files:
 audioplayer.as
 audioplayer.fla
 audioplayer.swf
 expressInstall.swf

Example files:

The player was inspired by MooSound. (We had to use jQuery.)

The flash player is mostly the same as the one used by MooSound with some changes.
