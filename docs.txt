The jQuery Audio Player plugin

==================
NOTES
==================

The plugin will load an MP3 or OGG file and play it. The running time and current
volume can be fetched and displayed.

There is much to do, such as:

* Add id3 data population of player title and description
* Allow an audio metadata structure to be used on the load function
* Playlist functionality

The player will be implemented as a set of plugins so that anyone can build the exact functionality
that they want.

==================
To Use the example
==================

Add the jQuery library v 1.2.6 and an MP3 or OGG file to the working directory and edit example.html to play it.

The player was inspired by MooSound. (We had to use jQuery.)

The flash player is mostly the same as the one used by MooSound with some changes.
