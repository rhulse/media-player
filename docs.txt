==================
NOTES
==================

The plugin will load an MP3 or OGG file and play it. The running time and current
volume can be fetched and displayed.

There is much to do, such as:

* Add id3 data population of player title and description
* Allow an audio metadata structure to be used on the load function
* Playlist functionality

The player will be implemented as a set of plugins so that anyone can build the exact functionality
that they want.

==================
To Use the examples
==================

Add the jQuery library v 1.2.6 and an MP3 or OGG file to the working directory and edit example.html to play it.

RELEASES
==================

# 0.11 (20 Nov 2008, later today) 

A bunch of small improvements to ensure the plugin API is stable under all conditions, and a new parameter that can be used during the initialisation phase to not load flash (for people who want to stick to free software). Also implemented the new type attribute in the audio tag.

The player now drives the timer updates via events. I figure most people won't want to think about formatting times so the player now sends an event every 1 second for the formatted time. (this will eventually be configurable to allow 1/10 second resolution).

There were also changes to the way the player interacts with the audio element.

The code for updating the audio item time was moved to a function to allow us to be more specific about when  it is called and also to help with moving to driving the udpates via events. 

# 0.1 

The initial release is fairly basic – you can give it an MP3 or Ogg file (in Firefox 3.1 which has built in Ogg Vorbis support) – and it will play it.

CREDITS
==================

The player was inspired by MooSound. (We had to use jQuery.)

The flash player is mostly the same as the one used by MooSound with some changes.
